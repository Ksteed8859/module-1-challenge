# Module-1-Challenge Webpage

## Description
This was the first weekly challenge students were expected to complete for this class. The goal of this challenge was to use the knowledge and skills we learned during our first week of class to properly edit a provided code so that the webpage is more accessible and easier to use. The provided code was lengthy and inefficient, and students were expected to use basic knowledge of css and html to reorganize the code into a more user-friendly order while still maintaining webpage functionality. While certainly not perfect, I think I did a good job at meeting all the project requirements and solidifying my knowledge about html and css.
